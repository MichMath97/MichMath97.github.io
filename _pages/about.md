I am a PhD student in the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), working with [Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/).
I am interested in reinforcement learning (RL) and am currently working on theoretical foundations of inverse RL.

Before coming to Tübingen, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at the Sapienza University of Rome, specializing in probability theory and mathematical physics.
